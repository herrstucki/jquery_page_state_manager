WHAT IS PSM?

PSM is a prototyping tool which allows you to define different states of
a HTML page. Each page element can be assigned to one or multiple states
in which it is visible. Additionally, you can define transitions for state
changes of each element.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE

Everything is handled by applying CSS classes to your elements.

Hello World Example:

    <div class="state_1 fade">Hello world!</div>

will fade in when you click on this link:
    
    <a href="#" class="goto_state_1">Say hello</a>

It will fade out when you switch to another state.

The initial state is "0", so everything with the class "state_0" will
appear when the page is loaded. Elements which do not have any "state_"
class assigned stay visible all the time.

States can have arbitrary names. If you assign a class "goto_state_foo",
clicking on it will switch to state "foo" and all elements with the class
"state_foo" will appear.

A more advanced example:
    
    <div class="state_foo state_bar fade">
        I will appear in states "foo" and "bar" and fade in and out
        smoothly.
    </div>
    
    <div class="state_not_bar">
        I won't appear in state "bar"
    </div>
    
    <a href="#" class="goto_state_foo force_fade">
        I will switch to state "bar" and force all elements to fade in or
        out.
    </a>

Another thing you can do is show and hide elements independently
of the page state (they can also have transitions assigned). These 
elements have their own state. You address them by their ID.

    <div id="hey">Hey!</div>
    <div id="ho fade">Ho!</div>
    
    <a href="#" class="show_hey">Show Hey</a>
    <a href="#" class="hide_hey">Hide Hey</a>
    <a href="#" class="toggle_ho">Show and hide Ho</a>

One last thing: you can initialize PSM to an arbitrary state
by calling

    jQuery.psm.init("your_state_name")
    
Actually it's the same as calling

    jQuery.psm.goto_state("your_state_name", {force_transition: "none"})

For more possibilities refer to psm_test.html

CHANGELOG

2009-10-21 (v0.1):
    Initial release
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO

- ability to set states using javascript instead of CSS classes, so it 
  is unobstrusive
- state conditionals (when in state 1 go to state 2 etc.)
- add more transitions
- go to page (page transitions, ajax loading)
- find a better name
